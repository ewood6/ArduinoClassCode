# ArduinoClassCode
This repository contains example sketches used in the Introduction to Basic Circuits and the Arduino lab manual. 
Also contained, is a clone of the install of the Arduino GUI complete with the libraries needed. 
If you have already installed the GUI, the libraries needed are also contained here.

Some of the code listed here is of my own creation, but most is example code from libraries (typically from Adafruit) 
or other examples from the Arduino website. If any code is lacking attribution, please contact me, and I will add it.
